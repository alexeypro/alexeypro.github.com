title: It's running now!

Well, it was not <i>too</i> straightforward, but I did it. The goal was to run "the blog", which would be very minimalistic and simple, neither will require me to think much. As I keep my notes in plain text, basically in <a href="http://db.tt/x9P2w6C">Dropbox</a> (which gives me quite a good feel of my notes been everywhere), I thought it'd be a good idea to do the same with the blog. None of the existing solutions, like Blogger, or Tumblr, or even recently acquired by Twitter <a href="http://alexeypro.posterous.com/">Posterous</a> - they are simple and nice, but I do not feel them "minimalistic". They used to be (or may be tried to pretend to be), but definitely not anymore.

So I tried something else. Decision was simple - <a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>. You can have it free. It uses <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/">Jekyll</a> behind the scene to actually generate all the static content. You create everything as simple as you want. And here we go - the source of my blog is right here  <a href="https://github.com/alexeypro/alexeypro.github.com">https://github.com/alexeypro/alexeypro.github.com</a> - I keep it open, and will do my best to keep it as minimalistic as possible, so don't hesitate to take a look and steal pieces of it. And design is kept dumb and simple by intention. I like it.
