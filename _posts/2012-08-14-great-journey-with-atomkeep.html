title: Great journey with Atomkeep
---
My journey with <a href="http://www.atomkeep.com">Atomkeep</a> started (as it seems now -- long time ago) back in 2008. My <a href="http://live.prokhorenko.us">brother</a> and I moved ahead with this idea, pretty much totally bootstraping it, in 2008, right on the edge of financial crisis and no funding rounds. We coded it, designed, grew. We got our fair chunk of crap, but also we got some great <a href="http://www.socaltech.com/interview_with_olexiy_and_olexandr_prokhorenko_atomkeep_com/s-0016423.html">posts</a> about it. And now <a href="http://www.socaltech.com/atomkeep_acquired_by_jobscience/s-0044279.html">we are done</a> with <a href="http://thenextweb.com/insider/2012/08/06/jobscience-buys-social-profile-syncing-tool-atomkeep-and-shuts-it-down/">it<a></a>. We had a bunch obstacles, and this exit is not something I wanted, neither expected... But it was a nice journey and we both will be going <a href="http://live.prokhorenko.us/get-ready-for-my-next-new-thing">for something new</a> soon..
