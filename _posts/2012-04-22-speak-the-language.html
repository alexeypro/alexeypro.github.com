title: Speak the language
---
If you ever wanted to get into iOS development, make sure you speak the language. Which is, Objective-C. Take your time and get to know that beast. Please, make world a favor, don't use all those fast-learning-guides, like "How to create blah in N days". Useless. Don't create new army of engineers who know "Rails" but don't know "Ruby". That's a pattern to retardeness and stupidity. The pattern to produce low quality low value software. <br/>
If you think within the same lines, I can't recommend enough this book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006GFZ288/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexprohshome-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B006GFZ288">Programming in Objective-C</a> by Stephen Kochan. Incredbible helpful, and an awesome starting point for you into the world of Objective-C applications. Money well spent.<br/>
You'll thank me later.
