title: crud-bones on Hacker News
---
Kicked out my boilerplate project <a href="https://github.com/alexeypro/crud-bones">crud-bones</a> to <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3872358">hackernews</a> -- if you like it, feel free to vote for it, or better - just use it. To quote myself from <a href="http://words.alexeypro.com/crud-bones/">crud-bones</a>: <br/>
<blockquote>
<strong>What the heck is that?</strong> <br/>
No, it's not an another framework. Chill. All this code is basically the template which I use to jump-start with new project. It has simplistic Model and DAO (MySQL and Mongo - which are interchangable), and all the usual set of Node.JS modules I like to use (I gathered them from across many forums, as the most stable and reliable). So, it saves me a ton of time. I clone it, and go from there. You can get simple CRUD right away, just change the model (yeah, it's very "opionated"). And if you feel like you need something more sophisticated just change the code!

Enjoy.
