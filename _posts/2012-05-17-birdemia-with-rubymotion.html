title: Birdemia with RubyMotion
---
As most people following the mobile space development mentioned, <a href="http://www.rubymotion.com/">RubyMotion</a> made some good PR for itself couple weeks ago. I couldn't stand but try it! And in about 2-3 hours I got <a href="https://github.com/alexeypro/birdemia">my app</a> out of the door. It is crappy and it is simple, but that's the best part of it. Available on <a href="https://github.com/alexeypro/birdemia">GitHub</a> and on <a href="http://www.alexeypro.com/birdemia.html">App Store</a>. If you saw shi^M^M^M <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1316037/">Birdemic</a> you will understand why my <a href="http://www.alexeypro.com/birdemia.html">app</a> is awesome. :-)
