title: Two best books on JavaScript
---
While I never liked JavaScript too much, I always felt it's because I don't get it quite well. The best solution for this problem is to attack it from all possible angles. I've been trying myself with it for a while, successfully and sometimes not, but it did help me to understand the language better.
Nevertheless, I should say it's not easy to wrap your "object oriented"-trained mind into the whole "prototype"-based world of JavaScript. But fear not. Two books is what you have to have to make this happen: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0057UNEJC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexprohshome-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0057UNEJC">Object-Oriented JavaScript</a> by Stoyan Stefanov and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026OR2ZY/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexprohshome-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0026OR2ZY">JavaScript: The Good Parts</a> by Douglas Crockford. They are the best in their kind. The gaps in each of them are well compensated by mixing those books together. 
Learn them by heart and JavaScript will be your best friend. Trust me.
And with all the rise of <a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> you better pay some attention to JavaScript...
