title: Performance Management and Optimi... Behhh!..
---
I told myself at least 1,000 times last year that I am not buying more books with buzzwords like "performance", "optimization", etc. and still manage to get myself into it. Now my rant is about <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DA0FBK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexprohshome-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B001DA0FBK">Pro Java EE 5 Performance Management and Optimization</a>. While I can't really say that it's a total dissapointment, but it's <strong>very</strong> close to it. I am sad, unfortunately, this book cost big $ and doesn't give me much. Nice overview, nothing stupid in it, don't get me wrong.. But if you want details and <strong>hard-core bad-ass</strong> value -- it's not there.
