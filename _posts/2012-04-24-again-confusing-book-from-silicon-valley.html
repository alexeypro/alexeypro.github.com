title: Again, confusing book from Silicon Valley
---
What is with all these titles? <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029NYE9E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=alexprohshome-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0029NYE9E">Leading and Managing in Silicon Valley</a> by Thomas Hempel, Jacob Taylor, etc. is by far the *most* confusing book for me I have ever read. Like a dump load of content, probably related together, but doesn't make much sense if all in one place. You get more if you just Google for the same topic. Sucks. :-(
