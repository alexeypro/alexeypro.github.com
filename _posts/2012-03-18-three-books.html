title: My 3 books
---
Right now, I just mentioned that there are 3 books that perfectly describe all my current interests. Coincidentially (or I guess not? ;-) I am reading them right now. They are <a href="http://amzn.to/FQqCv1">Pro Java EE 5 Performance Management and Optimization </a>, <a href="http://amzn.to/y92D4B">Refactoring to Patterns</a> and (while it's not technically a "book", but still) <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/MemoryMgmt.pdf">Advanced Memory Management Programming Guide</a>. While only one of them is absolutely new for me, I am trying to read every book like for the first time, absorbing everything from scratch. <br/>
But those three books perfectly describe my interests in <i>scalability</i>, <i>software architecture</i> and <i>mobile development</i>. I am not sure if I can recommend above mentioned books yet, but give me some time and you'll know. :-)
